Hi there!  

My Name is Florentin Raud.  
I have a passion for anything computers since I got my first one.  
I used to be an IT Ops for a living.  
That mainly involved dealing with Linux system administration.  
FOSS are important to me, not only because i make a living running linux servers, but because freedom matters.  
I try to promote the devops culture because collaboration works.  
I&#39;m also a member of non-profit associations revolving around these interest.  
To name a couple that are doing a great job :  

* [april.org](http://www.april.org/en/): their mission consist of promoting and protecting Free Software.
* [la quadrature du net](http://www.laquadrature.net/): they advocates for the adaptation of French and European legislation to the founding principles of the Internet, most notably the free circulation of knowledge.


## Contributions
Here is a list of open source project I contributed to:

* The [Open Company Initiavite](http://www.opencompany.org/): The OCI tries to highlight companies that take openness as a defining principle.  
The [contribution](https://github.com/opencompany/) revolve around translation and technical adaptation of the jekyll/github page instance towards internationnalisation.  
**NOTE: due to antagonistics view with the project leader, I no longer condone/endorse the OCI, see [this issue](https://github.com/opencompany/www.opencompany.org/issues/145) for more details**
* [Crewmate](https://github.com/crewmate/crewmate): A fork of teambox, a project management software with status wall, conversations, tasks, shared pages and file uploads.  
I&#39;m involved in the fork re-branding from both technical(code and documentation) and less technical point (finding a new name, logo, typeface).  
I also setup a jekyll/github page for [crewmate.org](crewmate.org), but it is currently underused.
* An init script for [Munin to graphite wrapper](https://github.com/kyzh/graphite-munin). Original script provided by Adam Jacob [http://github.com/adamhjk/munin-graphite]
* Adding an option and a feature to a [ruby api to the RedHat Satellite](https://github.com/duritong/ruby-rhn_satellite).  
* Translating [The Foreman app](https://github.com/theforeman/foreman/) and [website/documentation](http://theforeman.org/) via [transifex](https://www.transifex.com/accounts/profile/kyzh/).  

## Projects
I have a few pet project, usually created out of a particulary need:  

* [Mutuatar.io](mutuatario-kyzh.rhcloud.com.): A tool to compute Mortgage details with some other option available to compute some cost specific to the UK.  
* [guiro.org](guiro.org): My dad&#39;s own online presence, yet another jekyll instance.  

## Talks
* An ignite about [monitorama 2013](http://monitorama.eu/) at the [London DevOps days 2013](http://devopsdays.org/events/2013-london/program/).The video is unfortunatly [online](http://vimeo.com/79375936) so are the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/kyzh)
* I organised few graphite meetup in london.
* usualy I enjoy taking part in open space discusion such as the one that take place during DevOps days or other technology meetup. 

## Interests
I enjoy playing all kind of video games since i first play on my [Master System](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_System).  
My all time favourites would be the [Civilization series](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_%28series%29) and [Quake III Arena](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_III_Arena).  
Im currently playing [pixel dugeon](http://pixeldungeon.watabou.ru/) and its fork [shattered pixel dungeon](https://github.com/00-Evan/shattered-pixel-dungeon).  
Board games are quite a pleasant way to spend an evening, i enjoy particulary [the Settlers of Catan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Settlers_of_Catan), [zombicide](http://zombicide.com/en/) or a simple [Munchkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchkin_%28card_game%29) game.   
I don&#39;t mind kicking a ball around or wiggling a racquet when the weather is nice.  


That&#39;s all folks!
