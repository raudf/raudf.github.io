Over the last month I started to go some inbox cleanup.   
The goal is to avoid getting interrupted by email every minute.  
That include unsubscribing from more than 60 mailing lists, 40 google groups, a dozen github project,  meetup emails, amazon, ebay, twitter and other commercial product emails.  

There is a few open source project that I also put asside.  
I didn't contribute much to The Foreman, but I kept a tab on it.  
Now I likely won't anytime soon, so I choose to stop subscribing to the project mailing list, github etc...  

I'm also leaving the "Open Company Initiative" project.  
There has been few controversies, mainly with the project leader in the past.  
While not happening on the "OCI" directly but on gittip/gratipay.  
Gittip/gratipay is similar to "patreon", "subbable", "tipeee", "flattr": it helps people to get access to funds etc...  

I didn't put the effort to understand why or what was going on at the time.  
Here is the summary of [one such event](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Gittip_crisis).  
Other people have come forward to [voice their concern](https://modelviewculture.com/pieces/on-open-companies-consent-and-safety-among-other-things).  
An astute reader might realise that I'm leaving one project because of something that happened in annother project.  
Firstly, the leader is the same for both project.  
Secondly the governance is left (purposely?) unclear, for both project.  
Finally gratipay is meant to be an exemple of "open company".  

Do I really want to be part of a initiative that use as an example a company hostinga well known community that trhive on doxing people and hosting CP?  
I don't want to be involve with such a company from close or far.  
But that is not remotly as bad as being involve with the person in charge.  
If you want to understand the situation better, you might want to set some time asside and read this [gratipay github issue](https://github.com/gratipay/inside.gratipay.com/issues/118).  
Views that that find it OK to host "killer if they don't kill on my website" are [antagonistics](https://github.com/opencompany/www.opencompany.org/issues/145) with mine.  

To end this post with a more positive note, I'm still going to follow what the crewmate people are doing.  
I'm also getting involved in another project that has to do with food.  
Stay tune for more.
