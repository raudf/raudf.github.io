Vampires, Vampires, Vampires!  
I even like saying the word vampires!  


I found it really interesting that we colectivelly kept and nurtured the vampire social allegory.  
Not just the ones we picture in films and books nowadays and Arts in general, but the one that exists in one form or another accross the world since time immemorial.  

Our ancestor gaves us clues to figure something out. 
Clues to make sure not to let them get away with it.  
Why is it crucial that we know how to spot them, that we understand the tactics used to lure us and to realise what lies ahead for those who get charmed.  
But who is 'them'? Who are the 'vampires' of our world?

I've been pondering on the whole 'vampires' kind as of late.  
It started with the ["children of the fight"](http://hintjens.com/blog:78) blog post from  Pieter Hintjens [known for his work on *MQ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Hintjens).  
If you haven't already I would strongly advice that you do so.  
You should then logically go to the next step and read the second part called [From Dusk till Dawn ](http://hintjens.com/blog:82).  
After reading Peter's articles, I was able to put 2 names on the description ofered.  
This is because some humans behave like vampires or 'psycopath' for the less romanticise version our society has to offer.
It is difficult to spot them, as they hide in plain sight, unlike the sun avoiding mythological creatures.  
We, mere humans, with our empaty, sense of humour and love for the art could become prey to those psychopath who feed on and destroy our soul.  
If you doubt it, just work for the financial sector <insert adequate smiley here>.  

So who are those 2 people that struck me as 'vampires' ?  
Both are in a position of power.  
Both seems to lack basic sense of humour and get usually only get a laughter from their minions.  
Both show clear sign of apathy for the (little) world their reigned upon.  
Basically, they don't really care how detrimental it could be for other, as long as it leads to what they consider success for themselves.
A this point, you are probably not really reading this anymore, but thinking about the one in your environment that fit the bill.  

Then I started to think, am I on too?  
Could it be possible that I'm unknowingly part of the vampire crew.  
Solace came in the unconspicuious unpaired socks in my drawer.  
So I'm not a 'natural vampire' in a dracula sort of way.  
Maybe I wasn't paying attention and I became one?  
I don't belive that I became one (so far), maybe not for me to tell?

How to do you make sure you don't get turned into one then?
I don't know, yet I doubt its done through the use of garlic.
I would put my money on the threshold rule.
Not opening one's door to a psycopath, surely help not to let a psycopath enter's one life.
Logically next step is to make sure I don't end up stuck with a management that fitsthe depicted character description ever again.
I doubt I can avoid psycopath altogether, but as they are outnumbered, I'm sure I can minimise their effect one my life.  


We can colelctivelly acknoledge that 'psycopath' exist, but are they just too real to be faced as what they are?
Maybe we still need the 'vampire' allegory.
Even if it carries some cultural burden attached to a bunch of cluttered notion from a 18th century fearing society.

Hopefully by now, you are thinking about watching a good old vampire movie
Well if you don't you might be one of them ;)
I would strongly recommend you to [buy this film](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Afflicted-DVD-Derek-Lee/dp/B00MWULTOW) and maybe watch "only lovers left alive".  
Both provide a satisfing new view on the topic that completly depart from the whole narative of this blog post

TL;DR: Vampires are overdone as genre in the Arts, the same way this door is overdoing the use [warning sings](https://twitter.com/PaddyOClery/status/553484884464140288/photo/1) for a probably good reason.
