A quick bookmark post to remember that I have some backlog.  

I didn&#39;t had the chance to go to Ghent and take part to the last of kind devops days.  
Still I didn&#39;t forget to stay tuned.  

Here is the [program](http://devopsdays.org/events/2014-belgium/) for those interested.  
I already enjoyed the talk from [Lindsay Holmwood](https://twitter.com/auxesis) called &#34;psychology of alert design&#34; during [Monitorama EU](http://monitorama.eu).  
One of the quote I got from it was &#34;We are designing alerts for human, let&#39;s understand how human thinks&#34;.  
If you haven&#39;t already, I strongly recommand that you watch his [video](http://vimeo.com/75321812) and [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/monitorama/berlin-2013-session-lindsay-holmwood).  

Today i&#39;m interessted in his latest: [5 years of metrics and monitoring ](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/54694069).  
I cannot wait to watch it!
